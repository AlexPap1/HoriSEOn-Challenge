First I adjusted the id for seach engine optimization.

Next I adjusted header color including the 'seo' part of Horiseon, in order to make the header more visually stimulating.

I added alts to all images as well as CSS imagerecieved unseen comments. These are done to help with those who are visually impaired navigate the site easily.

I added comments for start/end of each div. This will help future developers have an easier time identifying aspects of the site for any future adjustments.

I adjusted the copyright to 2022 from 2019. This should be updated to the current year.

I added start/end for CSS header / hero / footer. This will also help with the tidiness and organization of the CSS file for future management of the site.

I moved hero styling css to one section. It was originally split with the benfits in between, which was not the most logical way to order it.
